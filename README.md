# What this is all about
This is a very simple Java EJB Project. Thank God for such an old framework. But I am gonna create Git repos to demostrate such frameworks in action. 

#How I classified this project
I create branches to monitor the progress of this project - beginning with master, and then leading to level 1, level 2 and so on.
